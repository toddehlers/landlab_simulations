"""
This file contains the input-parameters for the landlab driver. 

This does NOT use the landlab inherent load_params method but declares
variables directly in python and is loaded in the driver file with

	from inputFile.py import *

This was done because we do not use the standard-inputs for the
fluvial and hillslope routines but do the processing for
vegetation influence directly in the driver.

Usage:

	-Parameternames must be equal to the ones declared in the 
	driver file (better not change at all.)
	-Comments can be written in a standart python way
	-Any declaration of the same variable in the driver-file
	will overwrite the imported values so code-with-caution.
